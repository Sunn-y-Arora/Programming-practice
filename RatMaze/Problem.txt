Consider a rat placed at (0, 0) in a square matrix m[][] of order n and has to reach the destination at (n-1, n-1).
Your task is to complete the function which returns a sorted array of strings denoting all the possible directions which the rat can take to reach the destination at (n-1, n-1). The directions in which the rat can move are 'U'(up), 'D'(down), 'L' (left), 'R' (right).

For example
1 0 0 0
1 1 0 1
1 1 0 0
0 1 1 1

For the above matrix the rat can reach the destination at (3, 3) from (0, 0) by two paths ie DRDDRR and DDRDRR when printed in sorted order we get DDRDRR DRDDRR.
